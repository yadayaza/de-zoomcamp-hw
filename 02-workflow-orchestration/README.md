## Week 2 Homework

For the homework, we'll be working with the _green_ taxi dataset located here:

`https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/green/download`

### Assignment

The goal will be to construct an ETL pipeline that loads the data, performs some transformations, and writes the data to a database (and Google Cloud!).

- Create a new pipeline, call it `green_taxi_etl`
- Add a data loader block and use Pandas to read data for the final quarter of 2020 (months `10`, `11`, `12`).
  - You can use the same datatypes and date parsing methods shown in the course.
  - `BONUS`: load the final three months using a for loop and `pd.concat`
- Add a transformer block and perform the following:
  - Remove rows where the passenger count is equal to 0 _or_ the trip distance is equal to zero.
  - Create a new column `lpep_pickup_date` by converting `lpep_pickup_datetime` to a date.
  - Rename columns in Camel Case to Snake Case, e.g. `VendorID` to `vendor_id`.
  - Add three assertions:
    - `vendor_id` is one of the existing values in the column (currently)
    - `passenger_count` is greater than 0
    - `trip_distance` is greater than 0
- Using a Postgres data exporter (SQL or Python), write the dataset to a table called `green_taxi` in a schema `mage`. Replace the table if it already exists.
- Write your data as Parquet files to a bucket in GCP, partioned by `lpep_pickup_date`. Use the `pyarrow` library!
- Schedule your pipeline to run daily at 5AM UTC.
